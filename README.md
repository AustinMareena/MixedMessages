# Mixed Message - Codecademy Project

For this project, I will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they should get a new, randomized output. To make this program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. 

This project will be made using motivational quotes. It's expected that the individual would run this program each morning to get inspiration for the day ahead.

## Project Objectives:

+ Build a message generator program using Javascript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on my computer

## Prerequisites:

+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command Line
